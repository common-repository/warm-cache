Crawls your website-pages based on google XML sitemap. If you have a caching plugin this will keep your cache warm. Speeds up your site.

== Description ==

Crawls your website-pages based on any XML sitemap. If you have a caching plugin this will keep your cache warm. 
Speeds up your site.<br>
Compatible with following elements: < sitemap > < url ><br>
All urls in your sitemap will be visited by the plugin to keep the cache up to date.<br>
Will show average page load times and pages visited.<br>

Needs google XML sitemap to read the generated XML file.<br>
Needs a cronjob (wget or curl) to call the plugin. You need to setup the cronjob yourself! (Or ask your sysadmin to help you).<br>

<br>Upgrade option: Save you all the hassle and use our <a href="https://www.autowarmcache.com/">Auto Warm cache service</a>

== Installation ==

1. Upload directory `warm-cache` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Visit Plugins menu to view your Warm cache options.
4. Run a cronjob. See the menu for the cronjob URL.<br>Run it as often as you like, preferably more often then your 
page cache expiration time. <br>Example: Page cache expiration = 1 hour, so set your cronjob at 30 minutes.
<br>Set it higher when you have lots of pages


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I have a BIG sitemap that takes over 5 seconds to load =
>  use a filter called 'http_request_timeout'

= I have multiple (language / domain) sitemaps, but I can only add one sitemap! =
> Use a sitemap index, pointing to all your (custom/sub)-sitemaps. Only add the sitemap main index file to the plugin. Do NOT have this in the custom file name:
warmcache-sitemap.xml OR warmcache. Use this for example: supersitemap.xml or my_cache_sitemap.xml

= How to disable logging completely (for very large sites)? =
> Set a define in your wp-config (at the top, newline, after <?php ) with name MP_WARM_CACHE_NO_LOGGING_AT_ALL and value "yes"
Example<br>
Please check https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/warm-cache/trunk/readme.txt#L38 DO not copy directly below due to the "curly quotes"<br>
define('MP_WARM_CACHE_NO_LOGGING_AT_ALL', 'yes');

= How to run a cronjob? =
> Ask your webhost how to set up a get call using wget or curl. See Installation for instructions howmany times you should call the cronjob.

= The plugin shows an error, it cannot read the XML sitemap =
> The fact that you are able to "see" the XML in your browser does not guarantee that PHP is able to read it too.<br> 
Consult your host about this, if that fails.

= Sucuri / Audit log notifies about new posts beeing created =
> We use the hidden post type warmcache to store statistics. We also remove them upon each crawl.<br>
Feel free to ignore creation of posts with warmcache.<br>

= How to override the 20 pages crawl limit =

Example<br>
Please check https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/warm-cache/trunk/readme.txt#L58 DO not copy directly below due to the "curly quotes"<br>
define('MP_WARM_CACHE_FILTER_LIMIT', 25);
